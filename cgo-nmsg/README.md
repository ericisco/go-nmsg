# Golang bindings for NMSG

`cgo-nmsg` provides Golang bindings to the C libnmsg library.

The NMSG network message encapsulation library format is an efficient
encoding of typed, structured data into payloads which are packed into
containers which can be transmitted over the network or stored to disk.
For more information, see https://github.com/farsightsec/nmsg/.

A pure but limited Golang NMSG library is available with `go-nmsg`.
